### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an aspiring software developer from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ . I recently graduated from IIIT Bh with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science and Engineering and I am open to entry-level programming roles right now.

I code mostly using Go. If you wish to see some of my projects on gRPC services and REST APIs, check out the pinned repositories here on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/penthaapatel).

You can also follow along my programming journey on my blog -  [penthaapatel.github.io](http://penthaapatel.github.io/)  where I document my learnings about tech and programming.

Apart from programming, I love to paint, draw ðŸŽ¨ and play chess â™Ÿ.

If you would like to connect, you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/penthaapatel/).
